## Introduction

This is an analysis of a car racing event. It is done by analyzing data from F1 Results data table which comprises of resultId column,	year column,	round column,	Event name column,	Event date column, 	circuit name column,	lat column,	lng column,	code column,	Driver's forename column,	Driver's surname column,	dob	column, Driver's Age as at year of the event column,	Driver's nationality column,	Constructor name column,	constructor's nationality column,	Driver's  number column,	grid column,	position column,	positionOrder column,	points column,	laps column,	time column,	milliseconds column, fastestLap column, rank column,	fastestLapTime column,	fastestLapSpeed column,	status column, Driver's Full name column, and	Age column. The project was carried out entirely using Microsoft Excel.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this analysis is to:

- Who were the top three drivers with the most points in a specific year? 
- What is the average time it took for the fastest lap in each race? 
- Which circuit had the highest number of races conducted? 
- What is the distribution of race winners by nationality for a given year?
- How does a driver's age relate to their performance (points) in a specific year?
- Finally, the goal is to create data-driven plans that can aid in increasing sales, improving customer satisfaction, and driving the company's growth

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated:

- **Microsoft Excel concepts like:**

1 Data Importing and Exporting:

- Importing data from external sources such as text files, CSV files, databases, or other Excel workbooks.
- Exporting data to different formats for sharing or further analysis.

2 Data Cleaning and Transformation:

- Removing duplicate records.
- Handling missing values (e.g., filling in missing values, deleting rows with missing data).
- Converting data types (e.g., converting text to numbers, dates).
- Splitting, merging, or rearranging data across columns.

3 Formulas and Functions:

- Utilizing built-in functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN for basic calculations.
- Performing more complex calculations using functions like IF, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, etc.
- Creating custom functions using Excel's built-in programming language, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).

4 Data Analysis Tools:

- PivotTables: Summarizing and analyzing large datasets by creating dynamic tables.
- Data Tables: Conducting what-if analysis by exploring different scenarios.
- Solver: Optimizing solutions by finding the best possible outcome based on defined constraints.

5 Statistical Analysis:

- Descriptive statistics: Calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, etc.
- Correlation analysis: Determining relationships between variables using correlation coefficients.
- Regression analysis: Analyzing the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

6 Data Validation and Error Checking:

- Implementing data validation rules to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Using Excel's auditing tools to trace precedents and dependents, detect errors, and troubleshoot formulas.

7 Data Presentation and Reporting:

- Formatting worksheets and cells for improved readability.
- Creating dashboards and reports summarizing key insights.
- Adding data labels, titles, and annotations to charts and graphs.
- Inserting images, shapes, and text boxes to enhance presentation.

## Data Analysis:

Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at the desired results.

## Features of the Report:
The dashboard conveys information about the following key areas:
- The top three drivers with the most points in a specific year
- The average time it took for the fastest lap in each race
- Circuit had the highest number of races conducted
- The distribution of race winners by nationality for a given year
- Correlation of driver's age to their performance (points) in a specific year

▪︎A total revenue of £1.27 million was realized between the year 2013-2015.

▪︎With 77 products which Northwind Traders had in stock, they were able to receive 830 orders within the year 2013-2015.

▪︎£64,942 was spent on shipping of products within the year 2013-2015.

## Recommendation

- There are no doubts that the business is performing well as there are potential leads within the company yielding higher returns.

- The grains and cereals subcategories are not doing much in sales. Strategies to increase the sales should be made like "discounted bundle-selling" where for any purchase of beverages which happens to be the product with the highest revenue, grains or cereals will be added as an offer in addition to the beverages but at a discounted price which will be cheaper compared to when they are buying the grains or cereals as a stand-alone product.

 - Use database to gather customer feedback to get their experiences about the product or services. This information can be used to identify areas for improvement.

 - Understand Customers purchasing pattern by carrying out an analysis on this. This will tell what customers are buying, when they are buying  and how to promote the goods to the customers.

 - It is suggested that 8 products be discontinued so as increase the company's leverage.
